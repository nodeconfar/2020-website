             <h1 class="f-subheadline-l f2 mv4-l mv3 fw6 tc">Code of Conduct</h1>
             <div class="columns">
             <p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual
                   orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public
                   spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
                   disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
             </p>

             <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

             <p> Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use
                   sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
                   sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

             <p> If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they
                   deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

             <h3 class="mt0"> All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers are required to agree with the
                   following code of
                   conduct.</h3>

             <p> We expect participants to follow these rules at conference, workshop venues and conference-related
                   social events.</p>

             <p> Conference staff will offer help to participants to contact hotel/venue security or local law
                   enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
                   duration of the conference. Conference staff can be identified as they’ll be wearing branded
                   t-shirts.</p>
